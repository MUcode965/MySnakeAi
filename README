---This is my snake ai project---

-----------------------------------

To just play the normal game by yourself go in the run.py file and execute the run_normal_game() and commend the
other out.

-----------------------------------

To start training an ai, run run_ai_agent(graphics={bool}, graph={bool}, fps={Number of frames per second},
gamma={Discount rate -> int between 1 and 0 the higher the safer it plays}).
The graphics argument can be set to True so it will render the snake in each training or to False, which is faster.
You can also disable the graph.
The fps are just the rate on how fast the training is, more fps means faster but it will still be limited to the
computers performance.

-----------------------------------

The trained Model will be saved in the "-" folder under "model".
! If you want to save the model, copy it in the "SavedModels" folder.

-----------------------------------

To load a model run load_model_and_play(file_name={The name of the model to load in saved models},
game_fps={frames per second}).

-----------------------------------

Model files are saved with the hiddenlayer combo
